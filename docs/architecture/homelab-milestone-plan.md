# Homelab Milestone Plan

Authoritative milestone plan for the `platform-lab` project.  
Status reflects reality only — aspirational items are marked 🔲, not ✅.

> **Last updated:** 2026-04-05
> **Current phase:** TrueNAS Pre-req (in progress)

---

## Status Key

| Symbol | Meaning |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Complete and verified |
| 🔄 | In progress |
| 🔲 | Planned — not started |
| ⏸ | Deferred — conscious decision |

---

## Architectural Invariants

These rules do not change unless explicitly revised and documented in [`decisions.md`](decisions.md).

- **Terraform** provisions infrastructure: AWS EC2 and Proxmox VMs — with one bootstrap exception: the Automation VM is provisioned manually because it must exist before Terraform can run. All other Proxmox VMs go through Terraform.
- **Ansible** configures all host types: bare-metal (EliteDesk), Proxmox VMs, AWS EC2 instances
- Ansible roles are written to be reusable across host types wherever possible
- **Ansible execution** runs from the Automation VM — the Fedora workstation is for development only
- CI/CD is a single infrastructure delivery pipeline for Terraform-managed environments
- Operational commands are standardized through the root `Makefile`

---

## Makefile Reference

```bash
make tf-plan ENV=homelab
make tf-apply ENV=homelab
make tf-plan ENV=aws-dev
make tf-apply ENV=aws-dev
make ansible-baseline INVENTORY=ansible/inventories/homelab
make restore-test
make validate
```

## Milestone Sequence

| # | Milestone | Depends On |
|---|---|---|
| 0 | Lab Blueprint and Standards | — |
| 1 | Proxmox Baseline | 0 |
| 2 | Backup Architecture | 1 |
| 3 | Utility Node Foundation | 1 |
| 4 | Terraform Foundations (Homelab) | 3 |
| **5** | **CI/CD Infrastructure Delivery Pipeline** | **4** |
| 6 | Network Service: Pi-hole Limited Rollout | 3 |
| 7 | Monitoring Layer | 3 |
| 8 | Pi-hole Whole-Home Cutover + EliteDesk Secondary DNS | 6, 7 |
| 9 | Ansible Automation with Vault | 5, 7 |
| 10 | AWS Infrastructure Mirror (Terraform + Ansible) | 5, 9 |
| 11 | Reliability Drills and Platform Documentation | 10 |
| 12 | AI Capstone: LLM Inference as a Managed Platform Service | 5, 7, 11 |

> **Why CI/CD is Milestone 5:** The pipeline is built as soon as Terraform is proven locally, so every subsequent change is delivered through it.
>
> **Why the Ansible syntax check is included at Milestone 5:** `ansible-playbook --syntax-check` requires no live hosts. Adding the workflow early creates a feedback loop for every playbook written during Milestone 9.
>
> **Pi-hole sequencing:** Pi-hole is deployed to the Utility VM at Milestone 6 (limited rollout). The EliteDesk Pi-hole instance is deployed by the same Ansible role but is not activated as a DNS server until Milestone 8 (whole-home cutover), when the router is configured with both IPs.

## VM Reference

Recommended node assignments. Adjust based on resource availability at build time.

| VM | Node | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Utility VM | pve01 | Primary service runtime — Docker · Pi-hole · nginx target |
| Monitoring VM | pve02 | Observability — must be on separate node from Utility VM |
| PBS VM | pve01 | Proxmox Backup Server |
| Automation VM | pve02 | Ansible execution · Terraform workspace |

**HP Elitedesk 800 mini (bare metal — not a Proxmox node):**

| Role | Details |
|---|---|
| Corosync QDevice | Quorum tie-breaker for the 2-node cluster |
| Bare-metal utility node | Docker · Pi-hole (secondary DNS) · nginx target — Ansible-managed |

---

## Pre-req: TrueNAS Scale Install

**Objective:** Install TrueNAS Scale on the Terramaster F4-424 Pro, create the RAIDZ1 data pool with 3x 8TB HDDs, and establish the dataset hierarchy. Must complete before Milestone 2 — the PBS datastore NFS share depends on this pool existing.

> **Why a named pre-req and not a milestone:** The TrueNAS install is not a Proxmox VM operation and does not depend on the cluster being built. It can proceed in parallel with or before Milestone 1. Naming it explicitly prevents it from being silently assumed.

> **Hardware milestone (2026-03-28):** 3x 8TB HDDs purchased. Pool configuration: RAIDZ1 (~16TB usable, 1-drive fault tolerance). See ADR-016.

| Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|

## Milestone 3 — Bootstrap: Automation VM + EliteDesk

**Objective:** Manually provision the two hosts that cannot go through Terraform. The Automation VM must exist before Terraform can run. The EliteDesk is bare metal and outside Terraform's scope entirely. Nothing else is provisioned here — the Utility VM waits until Terraform is working in M4.

| Item | Status | Notes |

---

## Milestone 4 — Terraform Foundations + Utility VM

**Objective:** Install Terraform on the Automation VM, write the Proxmox VM module, and use it to provision the Utility VM. This is the first real `terraform apply` — and the point where the environment becomes consistent with the architectural invariant that Terraform provisions all Proxmox VMs (except the Automation VM bootstrap). Complete the Utility VM configuration once it exists.

| Docker CE + Compose installed on EliteDesk | 🔲 | Via Ansible — same role as Utility VM |
| Docker services persist through reboot on both | 🔲 | |
| `terraform fmt`, `validate`, `plan`, `apply`, `destroy` workflow documented | 🔲 | |
| `docs/setup/terraform-prereqs.md` written | 🔲 | |
| `docs/operations/utility-node.md` completed | 🔲 | |
| SSH key rotation — replace `fedora_ed25519` with `auto01` key | 🔲 | Terraform provider config (`environments/homelab/main.tf`) and Ansible inventory (`hosts.ini`) both use workstation key during pre-req/M1 development; must be updated when `auto01` becomes the execution host |

---

| Manual approval gate before apply | 🔲 | |
| `terraform apply` executes through CI after approval | 🔲 | |
| Ansible syntax check runs on PR | 🔲 | No live hosts required |
| Placeholder playbook scaffolded so CI has a target | 🔲 | Replaced by real playbooks at Milestone 9 |
| Pipeline documented in `terraform/README.md` | 🔲 | |
| AWS cost estimate documented before first apply | 🔲 | See ADR-011 · baseline estimate for EC2, S3 |

---

## Milestone 12 — AI Capstone: LLM Inference as a Managed Platform Service

**Objective:** Provision and operate an LLM inference service (Ollama) as a managed platform workload — demonstrating that any service class can be onboarded, monitored, and integrated into operational workflows using the existing stack.

---

## Deferred / Out of Scope

| Item | Reason |
|---|---|
| Jaeger (full deployment) | Deferred to M10+ — tracing value is low until multi-service request paths exist; all-in-one container planned for Monitoring VM once AWS mirror is live |
| Kubernetes | Complexity not justified for service count — see ADR-001 |
| Ansible AWX / Tower | Overkill for single-operator homelab |
| HashiCorp Vault | `ansible-vault` sufficient for this scope |
| Multi-region AWS | Not needed to demonstrate the core skills |
| Internal TLS / local CA | Browser warnings on Proxmox, TrueNAS, PBS, and Grafana are acceptable during build; required before app01 services (Nextcloud etc.) are in use — see ADR-019 |

---

## Notes

- Mark items ✅ only after verifying, not just after completing setup
- Update **Last updated** date when changing this doc
- If a planned item is dropped, move it to Deferred with a reason — don't delete it
- Docs marked 🔄 are written ahead of the build — update them as each milestone completes
